# DockerCalculatorTest
The provided Java TestNG code automates Docker commands to test a calculator CLI app. It verifies operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), handles division by zero, and checks for invalid operand errors. Tests run Docker commands, asserting expected outputs. Maven setup in pom.xml manages dependencies and test execution.
